//Exercise 5: Find the Power
// Write a program that calculates and prints the value of 2^n (2 to the power of n)
// where n is a positive integer entered by the user. Use a do-while loop to perform the multiplication.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class PowerCalculation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int base = 2;
        int power;
        int result = 1;

        System.out.print("Enter a positive integer for the power of 2: ");
        power = scanner.nextInt();

        if (power < 0) {
            System.out.println("The power must be a positive integer.");
        } else {
            int currentPower = 0;
            do {
                result *= base;
                currentPower++;
            } while (currentPower < power);

            System.out.println("2 to the power of " + power + " is " + result);
